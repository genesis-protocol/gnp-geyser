## GNP Geyser

#### Code update in progress, so stay tuned.
The GENESIS PROTOCOL Geysers are smart faucets that incentivize on-chain liquidity. Users receive GNP for providing liquidity on automated market making platforms (AMMs) like uniswap. The more liquidity you provide, and for longer, the greater share of the GNP pool you receive.
